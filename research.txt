dissertation structure:

	-programming model:
	graph processing programming model based on BSP. Why it is essential
for doing graph processing on the GPU?

	-algorithms:
	show how data-centric model can be applied to a variety of graph
algorithms.

	-operators:
	show how operators enable more algorithms while providing the same
level of performance.	

	-implementation/architecture:
	Load-balancing strategy and memory-related optimization.

=====================

Good introduction and motivation matter a lot.
